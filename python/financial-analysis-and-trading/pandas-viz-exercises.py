# Scatter plot

# Create a histogram of the 'a' column.

# These plots are okay, but they don't look very polished. Use style sheets to set the style to 'ggplot' 
# and redo the histogram from above. Also figure out how to add more bins to it.*

# Create a boxplot comparing the a and b columns.

# Create a kde plot of the 'd' column

# Figure out how to increase the linewidth and make the linestyle dashed. (Note: You would usually not dash a kde plot line)

# Create an area plot of all the columns for just the rows up to 30. (hint: use .ix).

# BONUS: Can you figure out how to display the legend outside of the plot as shown below?
